Twyne: an indieweb blogging CMS
===============================

Welcome to the **user manual for Twyne**,
an open-source web-based content management system
that is based around the traditional blog format of
chronological posts that can contain writing, photographs, and lots of metadata.
Twyne aims to operate within the `indieweb`_,
a philosophy of website architecture that prioritises
openness, interoperability, and a sense of personal control
for people running their own websites.

This user manual is aimed at people running Twyne for their own websites.
It covers installation, configuration, and general usage.
Any questions about anything in here
should be asked on the `issue tracker`_ on Github
(to do this, you will need a Github user account, which is free).
For any question that you ask,
we will endevour to fix up the manual to make it clearer about that topic.
